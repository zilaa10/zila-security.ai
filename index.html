    <div class="card">
      <h3>🧱 Multi-Layer Blockchain Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Each block is secured and validated by the previous one, creating a
        hardened chain of trust that prevents tampering and unauthorized access.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>🛡 Smart Contract Security</h3>
      <p>
        ZILA smart contracts are protected against exploits through secure
        validation logic and strict execution rules.
