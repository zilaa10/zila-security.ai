    <h2>Secure Block-to-Block Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Each security block strengthens the next one through cryptographic
      validation. This chained protection model ensures that any attack attempt
      is isolated and neutralized before affecting the network.

  <h2>Why ZILA is Strong & Secure</h2>
  <p>
    By combining decentralized consensus, military-grade encryption,
    and real-time validation, ZILA creates a blockchain environment
    that is resistant to attacks, manipulation, and system failures.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>🧱 Multi-Layer Blockchain Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Each block is secured and validated by the previous one, creating a
        hardened chain of trust that prevents tampering and unauthorized access.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>🛡 Smart Contract Security</h3>
      <p>
        ZILA smart contracts are protected against exploits through secure
        validation logic and strict execution rules.
